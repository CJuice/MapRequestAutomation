# MapRequestAutomation
This is a two step process. It automates the processing of a map request from staff and then manipulates the map document based on their request details. Step one establishes a new folder of a particular naming convention, and loads the folder with template files. The second step reads a text file, generated from a map request web form, and manipulates the project map document according to the requestors details. These two steps shave 30-60 minutes off of each map request (depending on the cartographers abilities). At time of creation there were about 200 map requests per year.
These scripts were originall crafted and loaded as script tools in ArcGIS and run as models/tools. When python toolboxes came along the code was moved to the python toolbox setup.
